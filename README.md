A package to fit analytical functions to binned time series data. Specifically written to fit pulse models to GRB prompt emission lightcurve data. It is influenced by the package PyGRB (https://github.com/JamesPaynter/PyGRB), and its purpose.

The package includes plotting capabilities leveraging the packages corner (https://corner.readthedocs.io/) and chainconsumer (https://samreay.github.io/ChainConsumer/). The sampling employed in the tutorial, found under examples/, used to derive the posterior probability distributions and the Bayesian evidence is the nested sampling Monte Carlo algorithm MLFriends (Buchner, 2014; 2019) using UltraNest (https://johannesbuchner.github.io/UltraNest/ ; Buchner 2021). The tutorial additionally shows an example using Emcee (https://emcee.readthedocs.io/), for the sampling (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013).
